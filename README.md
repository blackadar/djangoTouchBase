# djangoTouchBase
Django interface and report generator for school attendance and missing work tracking.

This project was created for my Mom, who is a gradeschool teacher who had to switch to remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. She was constantly fighting to figure out which students needed further discussion in team meetings. Every teacher had their own way of keeping track of attendance and assignments (and some no method at all)!

In comes TouchBase. TouchBase is a simple web wrapper which is intended to heavily utilize the admin panel provided for free in Django. With some heavy customizations to the admin interface, and some nice looking HTML5/JS reports based on simple DB queries, her team had a place to track attendance in **real time**, and have data-driven discussions about students who needed more attention!

Unfortunately, the project was killed by bureaucracy. Although I took many steps to protect the data in the server, it wasn't officially sanctioned and had to be taken down.

Luckily, I gained a lot of experience from this! I'm happy for anyone to use this, whether for example Django code or for actual school attendance. Just please cite my work and let me know how you're using it!
